#Variables

a = 1 

b = 2 

# Here a is not containing the value "1" (Like c or c++)
# a is just referring the value '1'

c = 1 

# Now even C refers to 1 

# print (c) = 1

f = c 

# now f refers to 1 not the variable C

# print (f) = 1 

c = 4

# Now c referrring to 4 i.e c = 4,  but f remains reffering '1', which is previous value of c; f = 1
